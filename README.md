# MyPA

This project is a (yet another) fork of the MyPHPpa code from Khan. The aim is to have an updated version for PHP 5 / 7 and many SQL-based databases by using PDO. Internationalization and basic security improvements (not suitable for public web servers) are also planned. Changes and new features to the game may be included in later releases.

## Original MyPHPpa

* The orignal project was once hosted at ~~[x-wars.net](http://khans.myphppa.x-wars.net/index.php)~~
* One of the latest releases is available at [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nezbit/)
