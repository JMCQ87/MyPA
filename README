You will need a Unix machine (probably linux) to run this.

I've run it on a MySQL-3 (You need to create a database there - 
mine was named planetarion), and PHP-4.
(NB: for mysql-4 you might need to convert some names)

To edit:

online/options.php  (especially dbname/login/pass)
online/sendpass.php (fill in your email)
ticker/myppa.cfg    (especially dbname/login/pass
online/motd.php for message-of-the.day

To create the database struct use paDump.sql, pipe it to mysql to the
created db. 
eg: mysql -u root -p planetarion  < test.sql

You probably should edit the 'send_pass' to put in an email 
account scanned by yourself, and edit the frontpage (index.php)
for email and index_msg.inc for messages. 

Same goes for all places with links to 'khan.stoney.cinetic.de'.

The admin pw is per default admin, mod's pw is moderator, both set
in last line of paDump.sql and ./online/admin/freset.php.

Go to the directory ticker, read the README.

If you want to provide stats to the users, edit ./scripts/dump_stat.sh
according to your needs.

Have fun, khan
